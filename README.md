## How It Works

### The App Concept
UNC AI is a productivity app featuring a virtual mentor who:
- **Gains respect** when you stay focused on your tasks
- **Loses respect** when you get distracted
- Provides **encouraging messages** during focus sessions
- Gives **gentle nudges** when you need to refocus

### Landing Page Features

1. **Hero Section**: Eye-catching introduction with unc logo and call-to-action buttons
2. **How It Works**: Three feature cards explaining the focus/respect mechanic
3. **Interactive Demo**: Phone mockup showing unc's different states and messages
4. **Download Section**: App store buttons (ready for your app links)
5. **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices

### Interactive Elements

- **Animated Respect Meter**: Shows current respect level with smooth animation
- **Cycling Messages**: unc's messages change every 4 seconds
- **Hover Effects**: Feature cards lift and scale on hover
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigation links scroll smoothly to sections
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press 'F' for focus mode, 'D' for distracted mode

## Customization

### Colors
The color scheme uses a professional gradient palette:
- Primary: Blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Secondary: Pink gradient (#f093fb to #f5576c)
- Text: Dark blue (#2c3e50) on white backgrounds

To change colors, modify the CSS custom properties or gradient definitions.

### Content
Edit the HTML file to update:
- App description and taglines
- Feature descriptions
- Download links (replace `#` with actual app store URLs)
- Footer links and contact information

### Images
Replace `unc.png` with your own unc character image. The design works best with:
- Square or circular images
- High contrast for visibility
- Consistent branding colors
